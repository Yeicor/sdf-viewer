## Introduction

*A fast and cross-platform Signed Distance Function (SDF) viewer, easily integrated with your SDF library.*

A Signed Distance Function/Field (SDF) is an alternative approach to design 3D objects.
In its simplest form, it is just a function that maps each point in 3D space to the signed distance to the closest
surface of the object. It can underestimate the distance to the surface, but it can never overestimate the distance.
A negative distance means that the point is inside the object.

SDF libraries will provide you with a wide range of SDF primitives, both 2D (rectangle, circle, text, etc.) and 3D (box,
sphere, cylinder, triangle mesh, etc.), and operators (union, difference, intersection, extrude, revolve, etc.) to use
in your designs. This application will take your code (written in any language) and quickly and interactively render it
to a window. The main objetive of this app is to speed up the design/modeling phase by rendering the changes to your SDF
as fast as possible.

I use this to design objects for 3D printing, but it can be used for any 3D modeling task.

## Demo

This example loads and renders an SDF with custom materials at the maximum framerate of **60 FPS on an integrated
graphics card** (i7-9750H). The initial load of the SDF is also interactive at 30 FPS (configurable): it quickly loads a
low-resolution version of the object and iteratively increases the level of detail until the SDF is fully loaded.
Parameters are configured from the UI, also rendering the changes in real time.

Another slightly more complex example (see [sdf-viewer-go](https://github.com/Yeicor/sdf-viewer-go/) for more
information):

- It renders an object defined using the Go language.
- It recompiles and reloads the SDF when a change in the code is detected

## Workflow

These are the steps to follow to start using SDF Viewer.

1. Choose an [integration](#integrations) depending on your preferred language and SDF library.
2. Copy an example project from the integration's repository.
3. Compile the source code to generate a WebAssembly file (see documentation of repo).
4. Display the WebAssembly file that defines the SDF with the app.
    1. If running the native app, use the CLI to set the path to the file or URL (`sdf-viewer app url <wasm-file>`).
    2. If running on a web browser, start a server to provide the file and add `?cliurl=<link-to-wasm-file>` to the URL.
        1. Chrome forbids synchronous compilation for wasm files larger than 4KB, so use a different browser for now...
    3. In both cases, you can also use the Settings window inside the app to set the URL.

Any change to the sources of the SDF would require you to repeat steps 3 and 4 to display the updated version.
This is a bit cumbersome, so the `server` subcommand was created to automate these steps. You give it a set of
files or folders to watch, a compile command and the generated wasm file path, and it will automatically perform these
steps for you. It will also serve the wasm file at a URL that you can give the app and, in addition, it will notify the
app of any update, automatically providing the new wasm file.

The `server` subcommand simplifies the workflow to:

1. Start the `server` subcommand with the correct arguments (see `server --help` or UI menu bar).
2. Start the `app` subcommand pointing to the server's URL (see `app --help` or UI menu bar).
3. Profit! When you modify and save your source code, the new SDF will automatically be displayed by the app.

*Note that all subcommands are also available in the menu bar of the application window. You can read the docs and
execute them from the app itself!*

### Exporting

Once you are ready to export your SDF, you can use the `mesh` subcommand (or UI button) to export it as a standard
triangle mesh. You'll have to select and configure a meshing algorithm.
The output is in the [`PLY`](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/) format, as it is simple (text-based), and can
contain material information embedded in the same file. You can easily view it and convert it to other formats with
tools like [meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/). You can also use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to perform a
[Smart UV Project](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/editing/uv.html#smart-uv-project),
[bake](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/cycles/baking.html) the vertex colors to a texture and
then [simplify](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/decimate.html?highlight=decimate)
the mesh without losing the colors.

Note that exporting a triangle mesh is a lossy operation (the triangles of the mesh only approximate the underlying
SDF), and you should keep the source code or the wasm file in order to export higher quality meshes in the future.

**Feel free to create integrations for other languages and frameworks and add them to this list!**

It is very simple to integrate with other languages and frameworks. The only requirement to provide support for a
language is the ability to compile to WASM exporting at least the core methods (getting bounding box and sampling the
distance at any point).

## Implementation details

### Rendering

The renderer is a GPU-accelerated raytracer. To take the SDF definition written for the CPU and render it with the GPU,
I had to fill a 3D texture that is then raytraced by a shader. This 3D texture represents samples of the SDF in the 3D
grid that contains the object. Each sample contains the distance to the surface and some other material properties like
the color and roughness.

Afterward, [this GLSL shader](https://github.com/Yeicor/sdf-viewer/blob/master/src/app/scene/sdf/material.frag) does the
actual rendering. This shader is applied to a cuboid mesh that represents the bounding box of the object. The mesh is
useful for only raytracing the part of the screen that may reach the object, and for extracting the rays for each pixel
from the hit points. The shader simply walks along the ray for each pixel, moving by the amount of distance reported by
the SDF on each position. If the surface is reached at some point, the normal is computed and the lighting is applied
for the material saved in the closest voxel. To get the distance at a point that does not match the grid, interpolation
is applied, leading to round corners if the level of detail is not high enough.

The distance function must always be equal to or underestimate the distance to the closest point on the surface of the
3D model. An invalid SDF would cause rendering issues such as "stairs" when looking at a flat surface at an angle. Using
this renderer is a nice way of testing for issues while developing objects for an SDF library.

I chose raytracing instead of meshing as building a detailed mesh is slower. While loading the SDF into the 3D texture
mentioned above, the shader is capable of rendering a real-time preview of the object, which provides much better
interactivity. This is enhanced by the fact that I do several passes to the grid slowly increasing the level of detail
by filling more voxels with data, in a way similar
to [bitmap interlacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlacing_(bitmaps)).

A high-quality meshing algorithm that preserves sharp features should be applied to get the final model, but the
objective of this app is to interactively render previews while designing 3D models through code.
