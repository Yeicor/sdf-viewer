# SDF Viewer ([demo below](#demo-try-it))

*A fast and cross-platform Signed Distance Function (SDF) viewer, easily integrated with your SDF library.*

A Signed Distance Function/Field (SDF) is an alternative approach to design 3D objects.
In its simplest form, it is just a function that maps each point in 3D space to the signed distance to the closest
surface of the object. It can underestimate the distance to the surface, but it can never overestimate the distance.
A negative distance means that the point is inside the object.

SDF libraries will provide you with a wide range of SDF primitives, both 2D (rectangle, circle, text, etc.) and 3D (box,
sphere, cylinder, triangle mesh, etc.), and operators (union, difference, intersection, extrude, revolve, etc.) to use
in your designs. This application will take your code (written in any language) and quickly and interactively render it
to a window. The main objetive of this app is to speed up the design/modeling phase by rendering the changes to your SDF
as fast as possible.

I use this to design objects for 3D printing, but it can be used for any 3D modeling task.

## Features / future plans

- [x] Cross-platform: desktop (Linux, Windows, MacOS) and web.
    - [ ] MacOS is not tested but should work (help wanted for [CI](.github/workflows/release.yml)).
    - [ ] Mobile support needs more work on the rendering dependencies.
- [x] Cross-language: easy to integrate with most languages and frameworks.
    - [x] Works by building your code for wasm and running it at near-native speeds.
    - [x] [Rust demo](src/sdf/demo/ffi.rs), observable and customizable
      through [this link](https://yeicor.github.io/sdf-viewer/?cliurl=demo_sdf.wasm&envdark).
    - [ ] Integration tutorial and list of available integrations.
- [x] High-performance:
    - [x] Very-fast initialization on all platforms.
    - [x] Interactive framerate, even while loading (uses the GPU for viewing the SDF).
    - [x] Loads SDFs in several passes, increasing the level of detail in each one.
- [x] Easily customizable:
    - [x] Different rendering materials (color, metallic, roughness...).
    - [x] Parameters to quickly customize your SDF from the UI.
- [x] Compatible:
    - [x] Upload your SDF to a server and display it anywhere by
      adding [?cliurl=\<url>](https://yeicor.github.io/sdf-viewer/?cliurl=demo_sdf.wasm&envdark) to the link.
    - [ ] Export a triangle mesh (importing should be provided by your SDF library).
- [ ] [TODO](https://github.com/Yeicor/sdf-viewer/search?q=TODO)s, [FIXME](https://github.com/Yeicor/sdf-viewer/search?q=FIXME)s and [HACK](https://github.com/Yeicor/sdf-viewer/search?q=HACK)s (any help is appreciated ðŸ˜‰).

## Demo ([try it!](https://yeicor.github.io/sdf-viewer/?envdark))

This example loads and renders an SDF with custom materials at the maximum framerate of **60 FPS on an integrated
graphics card** (i7-9750H). The initial load of the SDF is also interactive at 30 FPS (configurable): it quickly loads a
low-resolution version of the object and iteratively increases the level of detail until the SDF is fully loaded.
Parameters are configured from the UI, also rendering the changes in real time.
